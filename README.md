# ysetter-hackathon-commit-board

At the [Ysetter Reality](https://www.facebook.com/ysetterreality/) hackathon, where students have to build a software in one night, I created a board that displays the aggregated commit logs for each team. (The rules stated that all projects must be open source on GitHub, which made this possible.)

This board is built at the hackathon in less than two hours using React (create-react-app), so there's going to be a lot of hackish code inside. Kind of.
